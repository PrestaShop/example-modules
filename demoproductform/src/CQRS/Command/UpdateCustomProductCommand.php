/**
 * Product form is quite big so we have multiple command handlers that saves the fields and performs other required actions
 * This means you can also add your command handler to handle some custom fields added by your module.
 * To do that you will need to create your commandsBuilder which will build commands from product form data
 *
 * @see CustomProductCommandsBuilder
 *
 * It is example command, you can call it whatever you need depending on use case.
 * Command is used to pass the information and call related handler, it doesnt actually do anything by itself.
 * The name of command should reflect the actual use case and should be handled by a handler
 * @see UpdateCustomProductCommandHandler
