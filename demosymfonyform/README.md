# Demonstration of how to use PrestaShop Symfony form types

## About

This module demonstrates how to use existing PrestaShop Symfony form types inside a new page.

It provides two demo pages where all possible [form types](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types.html)
are being used. You can use these pages as examples of how to integrate these inputs in a module.
